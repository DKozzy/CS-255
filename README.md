# CS-255
Welcome to the CS-255 organization. This repository contains projects developed as part of the CS-255 Systems Analysis and Design course at Southern New Hampshire University. The course emphasized requirements gathering, system modeling, and software design, while also focusing on effectively communicating technical concepts to diverse audiences.

## About the Course

- CS-255 explores the principles, methods, and techniques of systems development, preparing students to create system models using industry-standard tools. Competencies developed include:
- Explaining systems development principles and techniques.
- Creating process, object, and UML system models.
- Presenting and articulating technical concepts to nontechnical audiences.

## What You’ll Find Here
This repository includes the following key projects:

- Project One: Business Requirements Document – Defines system components, objectives, functional and nonfunctional requirements, assumptions, and limitations for the DriverPass system. The BRD also includes a project schedule (Gantt chart) created with Lucidchart.
- Project Two: System Design Document – Expands on Project One by including UML use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams, along with a description of the system’s technical requirements.

Together, these artifacts demonstrate the ability to translate client needs into structured requirements and system designs, bridging the gap between business needs and technical implementation.

## Why This Project Matters

- The DriverPass case study represents a realistic client scenario requiring careful requirements analysis and structured design. Through these projects, I learned to:
- Identify functional and nonfunctional requirements to ensure a system meets performance, security, and usability goals.
- Apply process and object modeling techniques to visualize systems.
- Create UML diagrams to document user interactions, workflows, and system architecture.
- Communicate technical decisions clearly and effectively to both technical and nontechnical stakeholders.

## Reflection

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I focus on documenting clear requirements, using UML to model workflows, and considering security from the beginning. For example, DriverPass required secure logins, encrypted data, and role-based access control, all of which were built into the requirements to make the system both functional and trustworthy.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by analyzing interview transcripts, identifying pain points, and translating them into functional requirements. In DriverPass, this meant designing scheduling tools for students, lesson tracking for instructors, and reporting functions for administrators. Aligning features with user roles ensures the system provides value to all stakeholders.

How do I approach designing software?
I approach design iteratively, beginning with requirements, then developing models to visualize the system before implementation. By creating UML use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams, I ensured the DriverPass design addressed technical needs while also being adaptable and scalable. This structured process reduces errors and produces a system better aligned with client goals.

Future Applications

The skills gained in CS-255—requirements analysis, UML modeling, and clear documentation—are directly transferable to real-world development projects. Whether I’m gathering requirements for a new application, creating models for system architecture, or presenting design concepts to stakeholders, these practices will help ensure my solutions are functional, secure, and user-focused.
